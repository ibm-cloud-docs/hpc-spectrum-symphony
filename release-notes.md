Security update and enhancements
:   This release provides fixes for the Polkit Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2021-4034) and for the Spring Framework Vulnerability (CVE-2022-22965) within the RHEL 8.4 based custom image accessible by the solution. This release also removes the earlier Polkit mitigation implemented through changes to the post-provisioning scripts. The RHEL 8.4 custom image replaces the RHEL 8.2 image that was provided in the previous release. In addition, changes in the code now allow creation of compute nodes in the cluster by Host Factory on VPC resource groups other than the default group. And, security group rules have been added to provide more secure access to the cluster by allowing SSH from only specific nodes.

{{site.data.keyword.symphony_full_notm}} enhancements
:   You now have the option to use {{site.data.keyword.scale_short}} for shared storage that's accessible by the {{site.data.keyword.symphony_short}} compute nodes. For more information, see [Using {{site.data.keyword.scale_short}} storage](/docs/hpc-spectrum-symphony?topic=hpc-spectrum-symphony-using-spectrum-scale-storage). With the latest changes, RHEL 8.2 custom images take the place of RHEL 7.7 and CentOS 7.7 custom images with included optimizations for NFS. Additionally, the security vulnerability forÂ Polkit Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability (CVE-2021-4034) has been mitigated with changes to the post-provisioning scripts.

Further improvements include an update of the stock images that are used for login and storage nodes to RHEL 8.2 and clean up of entitlement and location input properties. Parallelism is now supported in {{site.data.keyword.bpshort}} `destroy` operations to help overall performance, and due to a bug fix, you can now avoid the Terraform warning regarding interpolation.
