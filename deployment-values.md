For more information on how to create an API key, see [Managing user API keys](/docs/account?topic=account-userapikey). | Yes | None |
| `cluster_id` | Unique ID of the cluster used by Symphony for configuration of resources. This must be up to 39 alphanumeric characters including the underscore (_), the hyphen (-), and the period (.). Other special characters and spaces are not allowed. Do not use the name of any host or user as the name of your cluster. You cannot change it after installation. | No | `HPCCluster` |
| `cluster_prefix` | Prefix that is used to name the {{site.data.keyword.symphony_full_notm}} cluster and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} resources that are provisioned to build the {{site.data.keyword.symphony_full_notm}} cluster instance. You cannot create more than one instance of the Symphony cluster with the same name. Make sure that the name is unique. | No | `spectrum-symphony` |
|`custom_file_shares` | Mount points and sizes in GB and IOPS range of file shares that can be used to customize shared file storage layout. Provide the details for up to 5 shares. Each file share size in GB supports different range of IOPS. For more information, see [file share IOPS value](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-file-storage-profiles&interface=ui). | No | `[{ mount_path = "/mnt/vpcstorage/tools", size = 100, iops = 2000 }, { mount_path = "/mnt/vpcstorage/data", size = 100, iops = 6000 }]` |

By default, the solution uses a base image with additional software packages, which are mentioned [here](/docs/hpc-spectrum-symphony?topic=hpc-spectrum-symphony-getting-started-tutorial). If you want to include your application-specific binary files, follow the instructions in [Planning for custom images](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-planning-custom-images) to create your own custom image and use that to build the {{site.data.keyword.symphony_full_notm}} cluster through this offering. Note: Windows 2016 version custom image hpcc-sym732-win2016-v1-4 is also supported. | No | `hpcc-sym732-win2022-v1` |
| `windows_worker_node` | Set to `true` to deploy Windows&reg; worker nodes in the cluster. By default, the cluster deploys Linux&reg; worker nodes. If the variable is set to `true`, the values of both `worker_node_min_count` and `worker_node_max_count` should be equal because the current implementation doesn't support dynamic creation of worker nodes through Host Factory. | No | false |
| `worker_node_instance_type` | Specify the virtual server instance or bare metal server profile type name to be used to create the worker nodes for the {{site.data.keyword.symphony_short}} cluster based on `worker_node_type`.

For more information, see [virtual server instance profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles) and [bare metal server profiles](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-bare-metal-servers-profile&interface=ui). **Note:** If dedicated_host_enabled == true, the available instance prefix (for example, bx2 and cx2) can be limited depending on your target region. You can verify with the following {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} CLI commands: `ibmcloud target -r {region_name}` and `ibmcloud is dedicated-host-profiles`.| No | bx2-4x16 |
| `worker_node_max_count` | The maximum number of virtual server instance or bare metal server worker nodes that can be provisioned in the cluster. To take advantage of the auto-scale feature from [Host Factory](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-symphony/7.3.1?topic=factory-overview){: external}, the value needs to be greater than the `worker_node_min_count`. Enter a value in the range 1 - 500. if you are using bare metal servers, the value needs to match the `worker_node_min_count`, and the permitted value is in the range 1 - 16. **Note:** If you plan to use {{site.data.keyword.scale_short}} storage, the value for this parameter should be equal to `worker_node_min_count`. | No | 10 |
| `worker_node_min_count` | The minimum number of virtual server instance or bare metal server worker nodes that are provisioned at the time the cluster is created. For bare metal servers, enter a value in the range 1 - 16. For virtual server instances with NFS storage, enter a value in the range 0 - 500. For virtual server instances with {{site.data.keyword.scale_short}} storage, enter a value in the range 1 - 64. **Note:** {{site.data.keyword.scale_short}} requires a minimum of 3 compute nodes (combination of primary, secondary, management, and worker nodes) to establish a [quorum](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-scale/5.2.1?topic=failure-quorum){: external} and maintain data consistency if a node fails. Therefore, the minimum value of 1 might need to be larger if the value specified for `management_node_count` is less than 2. | No | 0 |
| `worker_node_type` | The type of server that is used for the worker nodes: virtual server instance or bare metal server. If you choose `vsi`, the worker nodes are deployed on virtual server instances, or if you choose `baremetal`, the worker nodes are deployed on bare metal servers. **Note:** If `baremetal` is selected, only static worker nodes are supported; you will not use the {{site.data.keyword.symphony_short}} Host Factory feature for auto-scaling on the cluster. | No | `vsi` |
| `zone` | {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} zone name within the selected region where the {{site.data.keyword.symphony_full_notm}} cluster should be deployed. To get a full list of zones within a region, see [Get zones by using the CLI](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-a-vpc-in-a-different-region&interface=cli#get-zones-using-the-cli). | Yes | None |
