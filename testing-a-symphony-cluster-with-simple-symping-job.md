# Symping: the IBM Spectrum Symphony testing tool
{: #symping-tool}

The cluster management console allows cluster and consumer administrators to test that the cluster configuration is correct by running test work. It also provides information on the cluster's workload performance.

Use this tool to test your cluster configuration. Running this tool is often the last step in installation to make sure you have configured your cluster properly.

For settings, authorization, and configuration information, see [Symping: the IBM Spectrum Symphony testing tool](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spectrum-symphony/7.3.2?topic=workload-symping-spectrum-symphony-testing-tool){: external}.
